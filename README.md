M-Garden project (the Mobile Garden) project

How It Works;
M-Garden project is a multi-vendor e-commerce agribusiness website.
It allows a farmer to open an online market stall to sell wholesale farm produce directly to grocers(mama mboga)
It operates on three profiles: 
~Farmers:
    Vendors with wholesale or retail stalls.
~Grocers:
    Vendors with wholesale or retail stalls.
~Users:
    Buyers who can buy farm produce from farmers and grocers depending on their preference.

 I used 
    React.js for a fast, modern and powerful website.
    Redux toolkit for modern.
    Bootstrap for a beautiful and interactive display.
Vercel for hosting before production
